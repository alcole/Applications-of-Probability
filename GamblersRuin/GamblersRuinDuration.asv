function [ output_args ] = GamblersRuinDuration( a, j, p )
% calculate the expected duration
% Gamblers ruin in the style of a simple random walk, where p + q = 1
%  a - The Gambler and opponent have £a between them
%      If the opponent has unlimited resources set a to Inf
%  j - The Gambler begins with £j
%  p - The probability the Gambler wins a round of the game
%  q - The probability the Gambler looses a round of the game = 1 - p
%  qj - The probability the Gambler is ruined
